Welcome to the Tie::Hash::Static README file. :)

The idea is simple. Create an exclusive list of keys, all of which are
guaranteed always to exist, and any access to keys outside if the list
will be ignored.

You can also choose to have Tie::Hash::Static search a hash for an
accessed key, and if it exists, have it access the hash element, rather
than the Tie::Hash::Static object.
