Once you have downloaded Static-0.XX.tar.gz and have extracted it
into a convienient directory, make sure you have entered the Static
directory created before proceeding.

Run the command 'perl Makefile.PL ; make test' from your shell prompt.
If all goes well, all tests should succeed and you can continue on to
'make install'.

Enter the t/ directory and just run the scripts using 'perl file.t' to
test if you have succeeded in your installation.

If any test other than the first fails, there is a bug in the program.
I would be grateful if you could sent a bug-report to jql@accessone.com.

If the first test fails, you probably aren't root.
